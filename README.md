# Dart Reduce Method Error with Null-Aware Operator and Empty List

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when using the `reduce` method with a null-aware operator and an empty list in Dart. The `reduce` method requires at least one element in the list to perform the reduction operation. Attempting to use it on an empty list with a null-aware operator will cause an error, even if the list itself is nullable.

## Problem
The issue occurs when combining null-safety features with list processing. The `reduce` method is not designed to handle empty lists directly. Using it with an empty list will result in an exception unless handled appropriately.

## Solution
The solution is to perform a null check on the list before applying the `reduce` method.  If the list is null or empty, handle that case separately, such as by returning a default value.   Also consider using a more defensive approach to handle cases where the list might contain null values.

## How to reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run the `bug.dart` file. You will see an error. 
3. Run the `bugSolution.dart` file. It demonstrates a corrected version that addresses this error.
